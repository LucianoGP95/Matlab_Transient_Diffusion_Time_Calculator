# Transient-Diffusion-Time-Calculator
A simple project made in Matlab that allows to compute the time necessary to obtain the concentration of carbon at a given deep in a single carburization process. It relies in the aproximation by a lookup table to solve the error function that governs FickÂ´s secons law.
